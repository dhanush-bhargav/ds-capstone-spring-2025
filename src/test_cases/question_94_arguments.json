            {
                "argument": "At 18, individuals are considered adults and are granted other responsibilities, such as voting and serving in the military, so they should also be able to legally drink."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Lowering the drinking age to 18 would align with other legal adult responsibilities, promoting consistency in the law."
            },
            {
                "argument": "It could reduce the allure of drinking as a forbidden activity and decrease the instances of dangerous binge drinking among underage individuals."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Lowering the drinking age would help individuals develop healthier drinking habits at a younger age with education and guidance."
            },
            {
                "argument": "It would allow young adults to enjoy alcoholic beverages in controlled environments, reducing the risk of unsafe drinking in unsupervised settings."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Lowering the drinking age to 18 could lead to better regulation and control over alcohol consumption among young adults."
            },
            {
                "argument": "It would allow people to enjoy their legal rights, such as attending bars and purchasing alcohol, without legal restrictions."
            },
            {
                "argument": "By lowering the drinking age, the government could ensure that young adults are educated and informed about responsible drinking."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Lowering the drinking age could reduce the number of underage drinking-related legal issues and promote responsible alcohol consumption."
            },
            {
                "argument": "It would help decrease the stigma surrounding alcohol consumption and allow for safer social experiences for young adults."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Young adults' brains are still developing at 18, and alcohol consumption can negatively impact their cognitive development and decision-making abilities."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Lowering the drinking age could lead to increased alcohol-related accidents, injuries, and fatalities among young adults."
            },
            {
                "argument": "The current drinking age helps reduce alcohol-related harm and keeps alcohol away from individuals who may not be mature enough to handle it."
            },
            {
                "argument": "There is evidence to suggest that lowering the drinking age increases the likelihood of dangerous drinking behavior and alcohol dependency."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Drinking at a young age increases the risk of alcohol abuse and addiction later in life, which could have long-term health consequences."
            },
            {
                "argument": "A lower drinking age may place additional strain on public health systems, due to the increased need for alcohol-related treatment and support."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Young adults are more likely to engage in risky behaviors, such as drinking and driving, leading to higher rates of accidents and fatalities."
            },
            {
                "argument": "The drinking age is currently set at a level that ensures young adults have reached a certain level of maturity before consuming alcohol."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Lowering the drinking age could undermine efforts to combat underage drinking and reduce overall alcohol consumption among minors."
            },
            {
                "argument": "The current drinking age is based on scientific research that shows alcohol consumption can be harmful to younger individuals' health and development."
