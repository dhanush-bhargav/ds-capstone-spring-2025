            {
                "argument": "Labeling AI content ensures transparency and helps users distinguish between human and machine-generated information."
            },
            {
                "argument": "It can prevent misinformation by making it clear when content was created by AI."

                "argument": "Users have a right to know whether they are engaging with AI or a real person."
            },
            {
                "argument": "AI-generated content can be manipulated easily, so labeling helps maintain trust in online information."

                "argument": "Content creators should be able to differentiate their human work from AI-generated material."
            },

                "argument": "Governments and regulators may find it easier to track and manage AI-related issues if content is labeled."

                "argument": "Labeling AI-generated text and images can improve academic and professional integrity."

            },
            {
                "argument": "AI-generated content is often indistinguishable from human content, making labeling unnecessary."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Mandatory labeling could stigmatize AI-assisted creativity and innovation."
            },

                "argument": "It is difficult to enforce AI content labeling across all platforms and media."
            },

            {
                "argument": "AI is already widely integrated into content creation, and excessive regulation may hinder its use."
            },
            {
                "argument": "There is no universal definition of 'AI-generated content,' making labeling inconsistent."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Creative fields like art and music should be free from restrictive labeling requirements."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Labeling AI-generated content does not directly prevent misinformation or manipulation."
