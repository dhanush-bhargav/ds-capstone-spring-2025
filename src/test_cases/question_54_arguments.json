            {
                "argument": "Redirecting funds to social services can address root causes of crime like poverty and mental health issues."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Police departments are often over-militarized, leading to excessive force and unnecessary violence."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Many calls to police involve non-criminal issues that could be better handled by trained professionals."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Defunding encourages investment in community-based policing strategies that foster trust and cooperation."
            },
            {
                "argument": "A restructured police force could focus more on de-escalation training and nonviolent conflict resolution."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Data shows that increased policing does not necessarily lead to lower crime rates."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Police reform efforts have repeatedly failed, showing that systemic change is needed."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Minority communities often experience over-policing, leading to racial disparities in arrests and incarceration."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Defunding allows cities to prioritize education, housing, and healthcare, which contribute to long-term public safety."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Police unions often protect officers from accountability, making deep structural changes necessary."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Reducing police budgets may lead to increased crime and slower response times to emergencies."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Many communities, particularly in high-crime areas, rely on police presence for safety."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Police officers already face dangerous situations daily, and cutting funding could put them at greater risk."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Training and reform efforts require funding, so reducing budgets could hinder improvement efforts."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Defunding police could lead to an increase in private security forces, which lack accountability."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Crime rates have risen in some areas after reducing police presence, suggesting defunding could backfire."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Instead of defunding, police departments should focus on improving hiring, training, and oversight."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Police play a crucial role in preventing violent crime and protecting vulnerable populations."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Many alternative response programs lack the infrastructure and funding to replace traditional policing."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Effective policing reform should balance community engagement with maintaining law and order."
