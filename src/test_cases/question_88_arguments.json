            },
            {
                "argument": "Access to public benefits can reduce the financial burden on emergency services and hospitals that provide care regardless of immigration status."
            },
            {
                "argument": "It ensures that vulnerable populations, including children of undocumented immigrants, receive the care and support they need to thrive."

            },
            {
                "argument": "Undocumented immigrants should not have access to public benefits as they are not legally authorized to be in the country."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Providing public benefits to undocumented immigrants places a strain on public resources, which should be reserved for citizens and legal residents."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Allowing undocumented immigrants to access public benefits may encourage further illegal immigration."
            },
            {
                "argument": "It creates an incentive for people to come to the U.S. illegally in hopes of receiving benefits, which could undermine immigration laws."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Public benefits are funded by taxpayer dollars, and it is unfair to allocate these funds to individuals who have not contributed to the system."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Providing public benefits to undocumented immigrants could discourage legal immigration and undermine the integrity of the immigration system."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Undocumented immigrants already use emergency services, so providing them additional public benefits may create dependency on government assistance."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Access to public benefits should be based on legal residency status to ensure that resources are allocated appropriately to citizens and legal residents."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Allowing undocumented immigrants to access benefits could create resentment and divisions among U.S. citizens who are not eligible for the same benefits."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Public benefits should be reserved for those who have followed the legal immigration process and contributed to the country through taxes."
