            {
                "argument": "Violent video games can desensitize minors to real-world violence and aggression."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Exposure to violent content can negatively affect minors' behavior, increasing the likelihood of aggression and risky behavior."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Minors may have difficulty distinguishing between virtual violence and real-world consequences, leading to harmful actions."
            },
            {
                "argument": "The government has a responsibility to protect children from media that could harm their emotional or psychological development."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Banning violent video games for minors would reduce the exposure of children to harmful and potentially dangerous content."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Limiting minors' access to violent video games helps to create a safer, more peaceful environment for young people to grow up in."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Research shows that excessive exposure to violent video games can lead to a desensitization to violence and an increased tolerance for aggressive behaviors."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Violent video games are linked to an increase in hostile thoughts and emotions, which can influence how minors interact with others."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Restricting violent video games for minors helps to reduce the risk of violent behavior or bullying among young people."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Parents should be able to rely on the government to regulate content that is inappropriate or harmful for children."
            },
            {
                "argument": "There is no conclusive evidence proving that violent video games directly cause violent behavior in minors."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Banning violent video games for minors infringes on freedom of choice and the ability of parents to decide what their children consume."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Rather than banning violent video games, parents and guardians should take responsibility for monitoring and regulating their children's media consumption."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Video games are a form of art and expression, and banning them for minors would restrict creative freedom."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Violent video games are not the primary cause of violence; factors such as environment, upbringing, and mental health play a much larger role."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Banning violent video games for minors would set a dangerous precedent for censorship and undermine free speech."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Minors who are exposed to violent video games can differentiate between fantasy and reality, making the games unlikely to cause real-world violence."
            },
            {
                "argument": "A blanket ban on violent video games would be ineffective and could have negative unintended consequences, like encouraging the black market."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Instead of banning violent video games, we should focus on better parental controls and educating both parents and children on responsible media consumption."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Video games provide an opportunity for children to release stress and frustrations in a safe, controlled environment, without causing harm to others."
