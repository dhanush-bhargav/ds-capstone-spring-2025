            {
                "argument": "Detaining asylum seekers ensures that they do not disappear or evade the legal process."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Detention helps prevent individuals from posing a security risk or absconding while their claims are being evaluated."
            },
            {
                "argument": "It ensures that asylum seekers do not overstay their visas or violate the terms of their stay."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Holding asylum seekers in detention helps maintain the integrity of the immigration system."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Detention provides an opportunity to conduct thorough background checks on individuals before releasing them into the community."
            },
            {
                "argument": "It prevents individuals from engaging in illegal activities while their case is pending."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Detention discourages people from entering the country illegally by demonstrating strict enforcement of immigration laws."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Asylum seekers can be more easily monitored and tracked in detention, ensuring they attend hearings and follow legal processes."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Detaining asylum seekers reduces the potential for overcrowding in communities or further strain on public resources."
            },
            {
                "argument": "It prevents asylum seekers from potentially taking advantage of public services without proper documentation."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Detaining asylum seekers can be inhumane, subjecting individuals to poor living conditions and trauma."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Asylum seekers are often fleeing dangerous situations, and detention adds to their vulnerability and stress."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Many asylum seekers can be safely released while awaiting their case hearings, as they pose little threat to society."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Detention centers are often overcrowded and lack adequate facilities or support for vulnerable individuals."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Asylum seekers are entitled to due process and should not be punished before their claims are processed."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Detaining asylum seekers creates significant financial costs for the government that could be better used for legal processing or community support."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Asylum seekers who are detained may face long waits, often without clear timelines, leading to unnecessary suffering."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Detaining asylum seekers can be a violation of human rights, particularly for children and families."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Detention often leads to the separation of families, which can harm children and create emotional trauma."
            },
            {
                "argument": "Community-based alternatives to detention, such as monitoring or check-ins, can be just as effective without the negative consequences of detention."
            }
