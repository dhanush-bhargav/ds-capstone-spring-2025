          This exercise is designed to improve your critical-thinking skills,
          your judgments & decisions, and the related outcomes in your life.
        </li>
        <li>
          It involves a simple step-by-step method aimed at enabling you to more
          effectively address any issue.
        </li>
        <li>
          The method works by increasing the amount and quality of information
          you consider.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's important to acknowledge that everyone forms opinions (ranging
          from very negative to very positive) about encountered issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          Opinions are not only inevitable but also essential, motivating people
          to make improvements.
        </li>
        <li>
          However, our ability to solve problems and improve outcomes hinges on
          how well we identify and process relevant information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Therefore, success in this exercise requires you to put aside your
          prior opinions, at least temporarily.
        </li>
        <li>
          You should consider arguments and implications from all sides of the
          issue presented.
        </li>
        <li>
          The purpose of this exercise is NOT to convince you to change your
          current views.
        </li>
        <li>
          Instead, the goal is to make your opinions as reasoned and
          well-informed as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          The underlying principle is: a more-informed decision is a better
          decision, even if it doesnâ€™t ultimately change your stance.
        </li>
